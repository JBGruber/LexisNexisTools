Description: My PhD supervisor once told me that everyone doing newspaper
    analysis starts by writing code to read in files from the 'LexisNexis' newspaper
    archive (retrieved e.g., from <http://www.nexis.com/> or any of the partner
    sites). However, while this is a nice exercise I do recommend, not everyone has
    the time. This package takes TXT files downloaded from the newspaper archive of
    'LexisNexis', reads them into R and offers functions for further processing.
